# Os State

Simple app to display state of your machine

## Purpose

I built it to display state of my raspberry pi machine, which use as a web server.

You can find it [here](https://rasppepepi.kwapien.dev/), and if it doesn't work it means I unplugged my raspberry ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Running and building

It's a svelte app, if you want to run it or even build and deploy it, simply look for svelte docs.

Currently you can run `npm run dev`, or `npm run build` combined with `npm run preview`
